# AI From Scratch ðŸš€

Welcome to AI Concepts from Scratch, a repository where I implement various artificial intelligence concepts and algorithms without relying on pre-built libraries or frameworks. The goal is to provide a deep understanding of the mechanics behind AI by building them step-by-step.

## ðŸ“œ Current Implementations
1. Neural Networks ðŸ§ 
- Description: A fully customizable implementation of neural networks built from scratch using only NumPy.
Features:
- Feedforward and backpropagation
- Configurable layers and activation functions
- Support for custom loss functions
- Folder: neural_networks/

## ðŸš€ Future Implementations
Stay tuned for more concepts that will be added to this repository:

- Gradient Descent Optimizers
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
- Transformers
- RAG
...and more!


## ðŸ’¡ Motivation
This repository is built to enhance both understanding and intuition for how AI algorithms work under the hood. By avoiding high-level libraries, we dive into:

- Fundamental mathematical operations.
- Core programming concepts in AI.
